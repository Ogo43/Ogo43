### 🌱 About Me

🎓 I am a learner in the **ALX Software Engineering Program (Frontend Track)**, currently growing my skills in building beautiful and functional web interfaces.  

🔥 I started this journey because I see life as a place where solutions should be found with ease, and technology is the tool that makes that possible. Software engineering enables simplicity and efficiency in everyday life—and I want to be part of the team that makes a big difference. 

💡 I’m inspired by real-world challenges and passionate about **community-driven development**, inclusive design, and helping others rise through tech.

---

### 🎯 Vision

I aim to become a **confident, job-ready Frontend Developer** who contributes to inclusive, open-source, and impactful software projects across Africa and beyond. I want to create tools and platforms that empower others, especially underrepresented voices in tech.
